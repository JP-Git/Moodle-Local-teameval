# Team Evaluation

Team evaluation is a local plugin designed to be adopted by grading plugins which offer group submission; in other words, plugins where a group will receive a single grade for a single piece of work.

Team evaluation takes information from the students in a group, uses that information to determine which members contributed the most to the project, and then adjusts the invidual grades based on that assessment.

Team evaluation is in public alpha; we have just two question plugins, one evaluator plugin and a handful of reports. Contributions are always welcome!

Only Moodle 3.1 is currently supported. 2.9 support coming very soon.
